# Pokébase

Pokébase is a web application that will allow you to search for Pokémon based on certain parameters.

## Usage

To perform a search, start by clicking the search button in the top right. In the displayed menu you
can now select any possible type combination such as:

```
Fire/Flying
```

or

```
Dragon/Any
```

Then select which generation you would like to filter by, what stat you would like to sort by, and 
in what order (ascending or descending) you would like to see the results.

In the list of results on the left you can then click on a Pokémon's icon to view more detailed
information from Bulbapedia displayed on the right.
